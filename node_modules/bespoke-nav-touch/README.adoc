Download the {uri-raw-file-base}/dist/bespoke-nav-touch.min.js[production mode version] or the {uri-raw-file-base}/dist/bespoke-nav-touch.js[development mode version], or use a package manager.

=== npm

 $ npm install bespoke-nav-touch

=== Bower

 $ bower install bespoke-nav-touch

== Usage

This plugin is shipped in a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD format], meaning it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or as a browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  navtouch = require('bespoke-nav-touch');

bespoke.from('.deck', [
  navtouch()
]);
```

When using a browser global:

```js
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  bespoke.plugins.navtouch()
]);
```

=== Options

The following options are available when registering the bespoke-nav-touch plugin:

threshold _(type: number, default: 50 / window.devicePixelRatio)_::
The distance (in pixels) the touch gesture must travel (touchmove) in order to trigger slide navigation.

axis _(type: string, default: 'x')_::
The axis along which the touch gesture is registered.
A value of 'x' enables left-to-right navigation.
A value of 'y' enables top-to-bottom navigation.

=== Options example

Here's an example showing the options in use:

```js
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  navtouch({ threshold: 20 / window.devicePixelRatio, axis: 'y' })
]);
```

== Behavior

When you make a swipe gesture on a touchscreen device, the slides will advance opposite the direction of the swipe.
By default, if you swipe from right-to-left, the presentation will advance to the next slide.
If you swipe from left-to-right, the presentation will return to the previous slide.
You can modify or fine-tune this behavior using the available options.

This plugin works by registering listeners for both the `touchstart` and `touchmove` events.
If a single-point (i.e., single-finger) touch is detected, the plugin begins tracking subsequent movement of that touch.
If the distance of the touch exceeds the threshold along the specified axis, action is taken to advance the slide.
Further movements associated with that same touch event are then canceled (using `preventDefault()`).
Otherwise, the plugin does not alter the touch event.

This plugin should cause minimal interference with native and other custom touch gestures.

== Credits

This plugin is a fork of the official https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-touch[bespoke-touch] plugin by Mark Dalgleish.
This fork does not interfere with scrolling (see https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-touch/issues/1[bespoke-touch#1]), has 100% test coverage, provides a cleanup routine and is more clearly named.
