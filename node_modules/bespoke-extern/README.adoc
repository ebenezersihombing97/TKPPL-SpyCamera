Exports the Bespoke.js API to a global variable named `bespoke` and provides access to the collection of deck instances via `bespoke.decks` and the most recent deck via `bespoke.deck`.

This plugin is designed to give access to tools that need to control the deck, including presentation exporters such as deck2pdf and decktape.

== Example

http://opendevise.github.io/bespoke-extern[View the demo] online.

This repository includes a demo folder that shows this plugin in action.
To view it locally, you first need to clone this repository:

 $ git clone https://github.com/opendevise/bespoke-extern && cd bespoke-extern

Next, install the dependencies inside the project folder using npm:

 $ npm install

Finally, visit the file [path]_demo/index.html_ in your browser to see the plugin in action.

== Download

Download the {uri-raw-file-base}/dist/bespoke-extern.min.js[production mode version] or the {uri-raw-file-base}/dist/bespoke-extern.js[development mode version], or use a package manager.

=== npm

 $ npm install bespoke-extern

=== Bower

 $ bower install bespoke-extern

== Usage

This plugin is shipped in a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD format], meaning it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or as a browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  // additional requires
  extern = require('bespoke-extern');

bespoke.from('.deck', [
  // additional plugins
  extern(bespoke)
]);
```

When using a browser global:

```js
bespoke.from('.deck', [
  // additional plugins
  bespoke.plugins.extern()
]);
```

== Alternate approaches

There are other approaches you can take to export the Bespoke.js API and deck instance without using this plugin.
This plugin merely saves you the trouble by hiding the logic behind a plugin function.

=== Bind directly to the window object

You can bind the Bespoke.js API directly to `window.bespoke`, thus making it available as a browser global:

.src/scripts/main.js
[subs=+quotes]
```js
*#(window.bespoke = bespoke).deck =#* bespoke.from('.deck', [
  // plugins
]);
```

=== Use a module export

If you are using Browserify in your build, you can bind the Bespoke.js API to `module.exports`:

.src/scripts/main.js
[subs=+quotes]
```js
*#(module.exports = bespoke).deck =#* bespoke.from('.deck', [
  // plugins
]);
```

then bind the result to a standalone (global) variable by passing `{ standalone: 'bespoke' }` to browserify:

.gulpfile.js
[subs=+quotes]
```js
gulp.task('js', function() {
  return browserify('./src/scripts/main.js', *#{ standalone: 'bespoke' }#*).bundle()
    .pipe(source('src/scripts/main.js'))
    .pipe(rename('build.js'))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/build'));
}
```
