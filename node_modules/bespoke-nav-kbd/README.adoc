This plugin is shipped in a https://github.com/umdjs/umd[UMD format], meaning it is available as a CommonJS/AMD module or as a browser global.

For example, when using CommonJS modules:

```js
var bespoke = require('bespoke'),
  navkbd = require('bespoke-nav-kbd');

bespoke.from('.deck', [
  navkbd()
]);
```

When using a browser global:

== Behavior

This plugin activates the following keybindings:

[width=50%]
|===
|Function |Shortcut(s)

|Next Slide
|kbd:[->], kbd:[Space], kbd:[PageDown], kbd:[l]

|Previous Slide
|kbd:[<-], kbd:[Shift+Space], kbd:[PageUp], kbd:[h]

|First Slide
|kbd:[Home]

|Last Slide
|kbd:[End]
|===

NOTE: These keybindings are not triggered if a modifier key (e.g., kbd:[Ctrl]) is pressed (with the exception of kbd:[Shift+Space]).

== Credits

This plugin is a fork of the official https://github.com/markdalgleish/bespoke-keys[bespoke-keys] plugin by Mark Dalgleish.
This fork adds additional key bindings, does not capture events if a modifier key is pressed (except kbd:[Shift+Space]), has working tests, provides a cleanup routine and is more clearly named.
